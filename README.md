# Face_Recognition_for_Attendance_Monitoring_Systems
Took 12 photograph of each 5 members and recognized there faces for Attendance Monitoring.

– Developed a robust system utilizing OpenCV for automated attendance tracking through facial recognition.
– Collected 10-12 images of six classmates and divided them into separate train and test datasets for prediction.
– Applied advanced facial detection and recognition model(3 CNN layers) to ensure accurate identification.
– Utilized OpenCV, TensorFlow, keras and applied advanced image processing techniques to improved recognition.
– Achieved an accuracy of 0.93 for test data that contained 2-3 pictures of each person.
